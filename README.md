# Korean car licence plate detection and recognition
Korean cars licence plate detection and recognition using Keras.

Licence plate detection and Recognition is made by using Keras framework. 
You may find 3 folders that consist of separate implementation of 
* Detection part using Yolov3, 
* Recognition part implemented with CRNN 
* Program that combines both techniques

In addition, you can find synthetic Data generator that creates Plates, immitated CCTV and Parking images

I used ideas from other github accounts, combined them to solve Licence Plate Detection and Recognition Problem.
* YoloV3 (https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo3)
* CRNN (https://github.com/qjadud1994/CRNN-Keras)
